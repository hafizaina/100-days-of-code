# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Initial setup. Forked git repo.

**Thoughts:** Easy day.

### Day 1: April 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on iOS development and added an image viewer to the app.

**Thoughts:** So far, things are going good. I am having fun learning iOS and Swift.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on functionality to implement image picker for meal entry in the app.

**Thoughts**: I learned that in iOs there is a difference between views (of type UIView) and controls (of type UIControl which subclasses UIView). Views are simply dispayed items such as text and images. Controls, while being a subclass of view, are interactive entities within a content view. While implementing an image picker, I had a default image that the user has to tap in order to enable the image picker. However, an image is simply a view and not a control. With the use of a GestureRecognizer object, I was able to decorate the view object (UIImageView) with a gesture recognizer which recognizes a tap gesure, and there, I was able to transform the UIImageView view object into a control object.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
